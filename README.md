# Health-diagnosis-ML
Predict the disease based on the symptoms given by the user based on different machine-learning algorithms

***Objective:***
To develop a medical diagnosis system that predicts diseases based on the symptoms provided by the user. By leveraging the power of machine learning algorithms, I seek to enhance the accuracy and timeliness of health-related analyses, ultimately aiding in early disease detection and effective treatment.

***Theory:***
In the realm of healthcare, swift and precise diagnosis plays a pivotal role in preventing and treating illnesses. Conventional diagnostic methods might not suffice for severe ailments. Therefore, I have devised a medical diagnosis system employing advanced machine learning algorithms. This system can accurately predict diseases by analyzing an individual's symptoms, surpassing the limitations of traditional approaches.

***Datasets:***
The machine learning project relies heavily on training and testing the model with robust datasets. The necessary data is obtained from Kaggle, consisting of over 230 diseases. These datasets, namely prototype.csv and prototype-1.csv, serve as the foundation for training the system.

***Implementation:***
To achieve optimal performance, it is evaluated using three prominent machine learning algorithms -- $$Naive Bayes$$ $$Decision Tree$$  $$Random Forest$$ The rigorous testing yielded an impressive ***best-case*** ***accuracy*** ***of*** ***95.12%***. The implementation was carried out using `Python`, `Scikit-learn`, and `Tkinter` for the graphical user interface (GUI) components.

***Prediction Criteria:***
The diagnosis model employs a well-defined prediction criterion, i.e. if any two algorithms yield the same prediction for a given set of symptoms, the system identifies the corresponding disease. However, in cases where the predictions differ, the system refrains from making a definitive diagnosis.

***GUI Components:***
To provide a user-friendly experience, `Tkinter` is integrated into this project for creating an intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI). Python's Tkinter offers unparalleled speed and simplicity in developing GUI applications, making it the ideal choice for the application.

Through this innovative medical diagnosis system, I aim to act as a reliable and proactive healthcare companion, enabling early detection of diseases and potentially saving lives. By harnessing the power of machine learning and user-friendly GUI components, I hope to make a significant impact on the healthcare domain, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of disease diagnosis.
