# Health-diagnosis-ML
Predict the disease based on the symptoms given by the user based on different machine-learning algorithms

***Datasets:***
The machine learning project relies heavily on training and testing the model with robust datasets. The necessary data is obtained from Kaggle, consisting of over 230 diseases. These datasets, namely prototype.csv and prototype-1.csv, serve as the foundation for training the system.

***Implementation:***
To achieve optimal performance, it is evaluated using three prominent machine learning algorithms -- $$Naive Bayes$$ $$Decision Tree$$  $$Random Forest$$ The rigorous testing yielded an impressive ***best-case*** ***accuracy*** ***of*** ***95.12%***. The implementation was carried out using `Python`, `Scikit-learn`, and `Tkinter` for the graphical user interface (GUI) components.

***Prediction Criteria:***
The diagnosis model employs a well-defined prediction criterion, i.e. if any two algorithms yield the same prediction for a given set of symptoms, the system identifies the corresponding disease. However, in cases where the predictions differ, the system refrains from making a definitive diagnosis.

***GUI Components:***
To provide a user-friendly experience, `Tkinter` is integrated into this project for creating an intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI). Python's Tkinter offers unparalleled speed and simplicity in developing GUI applications, making it the ideal choice for the application.
